# Tally-Edge Push Notifications and Deep Linking Framework

## Objective Of the Project

To create a push notifications framework that can send notifications to client machines, whether they are mobile devices, desktops, or browsers.

## Problem Statement

Currently, TallyEdge relies solely on SMS for notification delivery. Push notifications can be implemented along with SMS to deliver low-priority notifications. Deep links can be embedded in these messages to allow the app to be opened directly from the message itself.

## Proposed Solution

Introduce a push notification and deep link handler in the TallyEdge backend and frontend that can push notifications to browsers and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack

- *React*: Frontend framework for building user interfaces
- *React Native*: Framework for building native mobile apps
- *Node.js*: JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- *Express*: Web application framework for Node.js
- *Deep Links*: URLs that link directly to specific content within an app
- *Design Thinking*: Approach for user-centric problem solving and solution design
- *Firebase*: Platform for building web and mobile applications(android/ios), used for push notifications
- *AWS Services*: Cloud services platform
- *SNS*: Amazon Simple Notification Service for managing and delivering messages

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
