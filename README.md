# Tally-Edge Push Notifications and Deep Linking Framework

## Objective

To create a push notifications framework that can send notifications to client machines, whether they are mobile devices, desktops, or browsers.

## Problem Statement

Currently, TallyEdge relies solely on SMS for notification delivery. Push notifications can be implemented along with SMS to deliver low-priority notifications. Deep links can be embedded in these messages to allow the app to be opened directly from the message itself.

## Proposed Solution

Introduce a push notification and deep link handler in the TallyEdge backend and frontend that can push notifications to browsers and mobile devices.
